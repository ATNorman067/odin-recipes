    <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF BEEF WELLINGTON</h2>
    <p>Beef Wellington, an elegant and flavorful dish, carries a name shrouded in mystery. Though it is widely believed to be named after Arthur Wellesley, the first Duke of Wellington, the exact origin of the dish remains unclear. Some suggest it was created to celebrate the Duke's victory at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, while others believe it was a patriotic twist on the French "filet de boeuf en croûte."</p>
    <p>Despite the uncertain history, Beef Wellington's popularity surged in the mid-20th century, thanks in part to its appearance on Julia Child's cooking show. Its combination of tender beef, savory mushroom duxelles, and flaky pastry delighted diners and solidified its place as a fine dining staple. Today, Beef Wellington remains a beloved classic, enjoyed for its exquisite taste and impressive presentation.</p>
